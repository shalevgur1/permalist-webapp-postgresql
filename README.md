This web application allows you to make a ToDo list. All things to do saved in a local database to make the data persist between sessions.

This basic application have been built to learn the basics of PostgreSQL and implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) database behavior.

To get the application up and running, follow these steps:

1. Run "npm i" to install all required npm libraries.
2. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed on your computer.
3. Import the permalist-db-schema PostgreSQL schema file to create the necessary database structure.
4. Update the connection credentials at the top of the index.js file to match your local PostgreSQL server settings (user, host, database, password, port).
5. Run the application using Node.js by executing the command node index.js in the applicationâ€™s directory.
